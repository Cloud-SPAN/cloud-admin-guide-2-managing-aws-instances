Please, do not alter this file. The actual file setup.md you can edit is this:
https://github.com/Cloud-SPAN/cloud-admin-guide-theme/blob/main/_includes/cs-common-content/setup.md

If that link does not work, please login first to https://github.com/Cloud-SPAN/cloud-admin-guide-theme/
then move to (click on) the _includes directory
then move to the cs-common-content directory where you will find the file setup.md to edit.

The file is included here automatically through the include command below

{% endcomment %}

{% include cs-common-content/setup.md %}
